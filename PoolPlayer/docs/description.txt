"PRAIS - the lord" is an autonomous and artificially intelligent robotic system capable of
playing 8-ball pool.

PRAIS consists of a tabletop pool board, LEGO Mindstroms based mobile
robotic unit, camera and a computer which runs the PRAIS software

The PRAIS software performs the following functions:
	1. Identify various types of balls on the board (Stripes, Solids, Cue and Black)
	2. Identify the location of the bot
	3. Calculate all possible valid shots and choose the best
	4. Compute the position for the bot to play the shot and plan the optimal path
	5. Command the bot to make the shot
	
At start, the system is set up to play either solids or stripes. 

The camera connected to the computer provides an ariel view of the pool board and the bot. 
PRAIS software uses OpenCV libraries to process the camera feed. First, all circular objects within 
the pool board are identified as balls. These are then classified as Solids, Stripes, Cue or 
Black based on pixel RGB and intensity values. 

The bot's position and orientation are determined using certain fiduciary markers. 

Next, all playable shots on the board, i.e., shots where a ball can be pocketed, are identified. 
The complexity of each shot is computed using rigid body dynamics and the simplest one is chosen. 

The position for the bot to play this shot is determined and the shortest path to get to this position 
is calculated using AI algorithms. 

Navigation instructions are then sent to the bot via bluetooth. Once the bot is in position,
the cue stick mounted on it is released. Once the shot is made, the cue stick is retracted and 
the system is ready for the next shot. 


A software engineer who dreamed to be a hacker since childhood. At school, worked on Train Derailment Prevention Sytem with a friend. Looking forward to continue this streak.
